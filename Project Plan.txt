🔹 Project Plan 🔹


1. Data Collection 📊
Scrape or use APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) for job listings.
Collect user profiles (skills, experience, preferences).
Use publicly available datasets (Kaggle, Glassdoor, etc.).

2. Data Preprocessing 🛠️
Clean and normalize job descriptions and resumes.
Use NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT) for text processing.
Handle missing values and feature engineering.

3. Recommendation Model 🧠
Rule-Based Filtering (location, salary range, job role).
Machine Learning Models:
Content-Based Filtering (match jobs based on user profile).
Collaborative Filtering (suggest jobs based on similar users).
Hybrid Model (combine multiple approaches).
Use ML frameworks like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

4. Model Training & Evaluation 📈
Train the model using job posting and user interaction data.
Use evaluation metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, and RMSE.

5. Web/App Interface 🌐
Build a simple web app using Flask/Django.
Deploy with a database (PostgreSQL, Firebase, MongoDB).
Implement a recommendation dashboard.

6. Deployment & Scaling 🚀
Deploy on AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
Optimize performance with caching and indexing.
