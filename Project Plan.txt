Set Up the Backend – Flask/Django project structure, API endpoints.
Integrate AI Models – OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, CodeBERT for code analysis.
Develop the Frontend – React + CodeMirror/Monaco for the code editor.
Build the Commenting System – AI-generated inline comments.
Code Suggestion Engine – Suggest improved versions of the code.
Testing & Deployment – API testing, UI testing, deploy on cloud.
